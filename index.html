        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Greetings, my name is Michelle. I'm a first year at UC Riverside, majoring in Pre-Business and planning a minor in Music. I enjoy drawing, singing, music, gaming, creative writing. My goal in the future is to create my own international (or East Asia centric) media franchise. I'm very honest since I don't see any point in lying in most situations I'm in. I think I'm humble; I do find it hard to compliment myself but then again, "your harshest critic is yourself", or so that's what I heard. I know to cherish my life and be grateful for small things, so I rarely hold grudges. I always try to understand and see all perspectives in arguments and situations even if I'm close to one party involved; as a result, I am very open-minded. I am a believer in the idea that if you work hard and have enough willpower, you'll end up somewhere more ideal to you.<br><br>

        Mathematics has always been one of my favorite subjects for several reasons. The "right answer" aspect of it makes me feel accomplished when I solve a math problem, because I know there will be a definitive answer. It's objective, to put it simply, or at least more so than most things in this world. That sort of precision is pleasant to experience. I enjoy that there are formulas we can memorize, to solve problems with ease, and the fact that there are various areas within the field of math. What math is most likely to affect is my career path. I have many options, thanks to my math skills: accounting, business, economics... the list goes on. Because math is so prevalent in many fields, I find it to be useful.
        I use math every day in the form of simple calculations. When baking, for example, I usually need to convert the Imperial system to the metric system, and vice versa, to interpret recipes and execute them accurately. However, it could be said that the place where I use math the most outside of school is when I'm playing games. Although I use multiplication most of the time, math has aided me in better managing my resources and performing better in games. On a more practical side, I apply this idea of evaluating the costs and benefits of a situation to make more valuable decisions when prioritizing certain assignments at a given time for instance. It's a lens for viewing my life in an orderly way.<br><br>

        My greatest talent is analysis. I was an observant person when I was little, to the point where I had a hard time thinking outside the box. As I grew up, I only further refined my analytical skills. Coming from this experience of narrowing my sights to focus on certain aspects of whatever I'm analyzing has only helped me to notice details that others may not notice. I also am refined in the task of organization, whether it is physical or electronically. I am able to efficiently handle tasks according to directions. I also partake in a bit of graphic design, and most certainly enjoy creative projects.
